Python’s Basic Data Types:
---------------------------
 - Python has several built-in data types that you can use out of the box because they’re built into the language. From all the built-in types available, you’ll find that a few of them represent basic objects, such as numbers, strings and characters, bytes, and Boolean values.

 - Note that the term basic refers to objects that can represent data you typically find in real life, such as numbers and text. It doesn’t include composite data types, such as lists, tuples, dictionaries, and others.

In Python, the built-in data types that you can consider basic are the following:

Class	                 Basic Type

int	                      Integer numbers
float	                   Floating-point numbers
complex                 	Complex numbers
str	                       Strings and characters
bytes, bytearray	        Bytes
bool	                    Boolean values


Python has builtin fucntions for each of diff data types to convert from one data type into another data type.

- int()
- str()
- float()
- boolean()
